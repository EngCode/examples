```yaml
./  # `lmstudio-ai/examples` repo root
 |__your_example_name/  # new folder you create
   |__code_file.py # or: .ts, .js, .cpp, .go, etc.
   |__README.md  # new README you create
#
# .. rest of repo ...
# |__... another example dir/
# |__... another example dir/
# ...

Each example should be contained in a folder and come, at minimum, with:
1. Sample code
2. README.md file containing installation / usage instructions

Note: your new example folder should be added at the repo root.
